/**
 * Galaxy Layout Engine — Phase 2 of PriceUniverse.
 *
 * Scale note: constants below were increased ~5x from the original
 * pass (centers, spread, height range) so the two galaxies read as
 * distinct regions in a large navigable space rather than a small
 * cluster near the origin. NODE_RADIUS/BILLBOARD_MAX_DIM/camera
 * distances in ProductNode/ProductImage/CameraRig were scaled to
 * match — this file's numbers only make sense alongside those.
 *
 * Visual pass: nodes are placed on a two-armed logarithmic spiral
 * around each galaxy's center (classic "spiral galaxy" silhouette)
 * instead of scattered randomly in a disc. Distance-from-center,
 * angle-along-arm, and vertical scatter are all still deterministic
 * per-node (hashToUnit(node.id)), so layout is stable across
 * re-renders and re-fetches — same node always lands in the same
 * spot. Only the *shape* of the distribution changed; price still
 * drives height (y) exactly as before.

// Hero composition pass: both galaxies shifted right and apart so the

// visually clear. Jumia moved from a symmetric -28 to a modest +6 —
// still left-of-center relative to Jiji, but no longer sitting under
// the text column. Jiji pushed further right (52, up from 28) and
// back in z (-18) so it reads as more distant, adding depth and
// letting it partially extend off the right edge of the viewport
// rather than sitting fully centered, matching the reference's
// "galaxies breathe, don't feel boxed-in" framing. These numbers are
// paired with CameraRig's DEFAULT_CAMERA_POSITION/target offset —
// changing one without the other will throw off the composition.
// Centers widened proportionally to the GALAXY_RADIUS increase
